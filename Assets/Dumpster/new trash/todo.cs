//todo 0 add todos here


//todo 1 make player movement
//todo 2 make better player interaction with pc, selected pc state
//todo 6 try more with using static for example with String from System.String
// ^ allowing just System allows System.IO so you can just get hacked

//todo 3 shell, just compiles everytinh to itself - bad
//add some loading logic from Hardware (for example loading code from file BUT it needs to be like connected to Shell?)
//this is important BUT too hard for now, so it is just 3

//todo 0 fix ls not showing current dir contents
//todo 6 fix Command not found on Capital letters, idk?

/*notes:
- how to run code?
    
    - maybe join with appdomain? it needs to have the same statics
        - maybe globals? those can suck tho
    - task/thread needs to stop/wait for other task/thread/CODE to finish
    - this is hard. Test it.

/*
 CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync jest async blokuje w?tek jak sie wykonuje
wi?c po prostu zrób 1 main w?tek do uruchamiania kodu dla pc
i potem na TYM SAMYM w?tku mo?esz uruchamia? kolejne bez async
zastopuje to wszytsko
przekazywanie danych dalerj probelmem mo?e by? ale np pp domain alebo te globvale.

//todo 0!!!! make list of allowed classes from libraries
//make preprocessor to add to this list
//check if user added something outside of this list
//if so, throw error
//how to disallow adding this preprocessor?
//dogshit ^









//stfu \/




//idea: special function in some text inputs to be replaced by values ???? <- idk

//todo 99 add lolcat command and CT
//todo 1? flags in hardware as list of strings?. You want to make RectArray(and etc.) ignore some errors BUT you also want it toggleable


//future


//todo-future rethink graphical interface. Maybe it should be more C like?

//todo-future add png and jpeg files

//todo-future add more file types/extensions
//todo-future add option to compress libraries (remove whitespaces, add redefines etc)

//todo-far future think and make better workflow for files.
//todo-far future make plugin for #?
//recheck



//done?  think if fileSystem should be it's own library AND if it should use thread function stack or just lock files. Locking is good i guess
//todo-recheck test this ^
