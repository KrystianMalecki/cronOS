//future

//todo-future add compressed textures/pallet based images
//SystemColor is 0-16 so 4 bits so 2 can be compressed into 1 byte. Same thing with black-white children like fonts or masks.


//todo-future add lolcat command and CT
//todo-future add texture tinting

//todo-future rethink graphical interface. Maybe it should be more C like?

//todo-future add png and jpeg files

//todo-future add more file types/extensions
//todo-future add option to compress libraries (remove whitespaces, add redefines etc)


//recheck

//todo-recheck fix enum mask error in inspector, use default enum mask drawer, just add display for options next to it, its ok


//todo-recheck fix mouseHandler by using screen matrix]
