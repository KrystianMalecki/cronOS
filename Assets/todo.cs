//BUT changing WD will be really problematic. Should you fight it? idk. Maybe just make them return special commands? like "cmd: cwd *paste path here*" and something that is running those should do something with it?

//todo 3 think about better path logic

//todo 4 think about #include-ing core libraries like system or system.file_system
