//todo 0 add todos here
//todo 91 go back to sounds

//todo 99 add lolcat command and CT
//todo 1? flags in hardware as list of strings?. You want to make RectArray(and etc.) ignore some errors BUT you also want it toggleable

//todo 1? you also wanted to run stuff from shell because it would be easier to reuse ScreenBuffer.
//BUT this would also make it non-window-compatible? You can just pass ScreenBuffer from shell and if you want to use it in window, you can just pass new buffer from window object.
//think about this^

//future


//todo-future rethink graphical interface. Maybe it should be more C like?

//todo-future add png and jpeg files

//todo-future add more file types/extensions
//todo-future add option to compress libraries (remove whitespaces, add redefines etc)

//todo-far future think and make better workflow for files.
//todo-far future make plugin for #?
//recheck

//todo-recheck fix enum mask error in inspector, use default enum mask drawer, just add display for options next to it, its ok


//done?  think if fileSystem should be it's own library AND if it should use thread function stack or just lock files. Locking is good i guess
//todo-recheck test this ^
