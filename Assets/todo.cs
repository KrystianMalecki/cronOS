//todo 0 add todos here

//todo-future add alpha channel to textures and texture files, add compressed textures
//SystemColor is 0-16 so 4 bits so 2 can be compressed into 1 byte. Same thing with black-white files like fonts or masks.

//todo 1 fix special characters not working. Done, needs more testing
//there is no 'C', '{', '-', '!' etc because they use Shift key. This is hard because you need to support different keyboard layouts.
//Probably combine inputString with KeyCode raw checking.
